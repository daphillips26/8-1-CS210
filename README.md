# 8-1-CS210

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involves creating a clock manipulation program in C++. It allows users to input an initial time and then increment the time by one hour, one minute, or one second based on user choices. The program displays the time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I implemented modular functions for time manipulation, ensuring code reusability. The use of functions like addOneHour(), addOneMinute(), and addOneSecond() enhances readability and maintainability. The program also validates input and handles user choices effectively.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Improvements could include better commenting for function explanations and code clarity. Additionally, incorporating error handling for invalid user inputs would enhance robustness. Implementing boundary checks in the switch statement and providing default cases for unexpected inputs would improve security and prevent potential runtime issues.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Handling user input and ensuring smooth flow in the program presented challenges. I overcame this by carefully designing the user interaction flow and testing various scenarios. Online C++ forums and documentation served as valuable resources for addressing specific syntax and functionality questions.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
The project reinforced skills in modular programming, user input validation, and switch statement usage. These skills are foundational and transferable to various programming tasks, aiding in the development of efficient and user-friendly applications.
